      <p>Requiring users to transcribe a password by modifying the password input format is a failure to meet Success Criteria 3.3.8 and 3.3.9 (unless alternative authenticaton methods are available). Using an input format that differs from the format in which the password is stored in a password manager or local copy of the password means that users cannot avoid transcription, resulting in a <a href="../understanding/22/accessible-authentication.html#dfn-cognitive-function-test">cognitive function test</a>.</p>

            <p>The following example incorrectly uses white space to format a Menu
                                as a visual table.</p>
         
         <pre xml:space="preserve">
Menu
         Breakfast        Lunch           Dinner

Monday   2 fried eggs    tomato soup     garden salad
         bacon           hamburger       Fried Chicken
         toast           onion rings     green beans
                         Oatmeal cookie  mashed potatoes

            <p>If this table was to be interpreted and spoken by a screen reader it
                                would speak the following lines:</p>
            <ul>
               <li>Menu</li>
               <li>Breakfast Lunch Dinner</li>

               <li>Oatmeal cookie mashed potatoes</li>
            </ul>
            <p>This reading order does not make sense since there is no structure in
                                the table for the assistive technology to identify it as a table. If
                                the text were reflowed, or changed from a fixed to a variable font,
                                or increased in size until lines no longer fit on the page, similar
                                issues would arise in the visual presentation.</p>
