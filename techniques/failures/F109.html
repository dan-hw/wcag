   </section><section id="description"><h2>Description</h2>
      <p>Requiring users to transcribe a password by modifying the password input format is a failure to meet Success Criteria 3.3.8 and 3.3.9 (unless alternative authenticaton methods are available). Using an input format that differs from the format in which the password is stored in a password manager or local copy of the password means that users cannot avoid transcription, resulting in a <a href="../../understanding/22/accessible-authentication.html#dfn-cognitive-function-test">cognitive function test</a>.</p>
				
      
   </section><section id="examples"><h2>Examples</h2>
   These  examples would prevent a user from auto-filling a password using a password manager, or copying the password into a field:
     <ul>
				<li>A fieldset that prompts a user to "Enter the 2nd, 6th and last characters of your password", with separate input fields for each character</li>
				<li>A fieldset that prompts a user to enter all digits of a 6-digit passcode, across 6 individual fields.</li>
        <li>A password input fieldset composed of <code class="el">&lt;select&gt;</code> elements that requires a user to select each character of a fixed-length password from individual dropdown fields.</li>
			</ul>

   <section id="tests"><h2>Tests</h2>
      <section class="procedure"><h3>Procedure</h3>
         <ol>
            <li>Check whether the password input format prevents the user from pasting or auto-filling their entire password in one action.</li>
            <li>Confirm that no other acceptable authentication methods are present that satisfy Success Criteria 3.3.8 or 3.39 (such as an authentication method that does not rely on a cognitive function test).</li>
         </ol>

      <section class="results"><h3>Expected Results</h3>
         <ul>
            <li>If steps #1 and #2 are true, then this failure condition applies and content
                            fails the Success Criterion.</li>
